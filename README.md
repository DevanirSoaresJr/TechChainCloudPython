## 📌 About the Project

**TechChainCloudPython** is my first official project in a full-time transformation journey (July–November 2025) from IT Service Desk Analyst to Python Developer and Cloud Engineer.

> 🧠 Every feature, every commit, and every bug fixed reflects something I’ve learned hands-on.

This repo is public by design: to document progress, get feedback, and learn in public while building a job-ready skillset.
